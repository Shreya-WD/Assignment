    <h1>HTML Assignment</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>(1). Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h2>

            =>.No,<b>HTML</b> tags and elements are not the same thing, although the terms are often used interchangeably.
        <p> An HTML element is a part of an HTML document that defines how the content within it should be structured
            and presented to the user.
        </p>
        <p> An element consists of an opening tag, the content of the element, and a closing tag.</p>
            For example, the &lt;p&gt; element is used to indicate a paragraph of text in an HTML document, and it is represented
            by the opening tag   &lt;p&gt; and the closing tag &lt;/p&gt;.
        </p>
            <hr>
    <h2>(2).What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h2>
   
           =>.Tags are used to mark up different parts of the content within an HTML document, indicating their meaning and function.
        <p>HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically consist of a tag name, such as <div> or  &lt;p&gt;, that defines the
           type of element being marked up. For example, the &lt;p&gt; tag is used to indicate a paragraph of text, while the <img> tag is 
           used to insert an image.
        </p>
        <p>Attributes, on the other hand, are used to provide additional information about an HTML element, such as its size, color, or location.</p>
        <p>Attributes are always specified within the opening tag of an element, and they provide specific details about how the element should
            be rendered on the page.</p>
        <p>For example, the src attribute in the <img> tag specifies the URL of the image to be displayed, while the
            href attribute in the <a> tag specifies the URL of the page that the link should point to.</p>
           Example-	<p style="color: blueviolet;">This is a blueviolet paragraph.

        <p>In this example, the &lt;p&gt; tag is used to define a paragraph of text, and the style attribute is used to set the color of the text to red.</p>
            <hr>
        
    <h2>(3).What are void elements in HTML? With Example.</h2>

          =>In HTML, a void element is an element that doesn't have a closing tag and is self-closing. 
        <p>Void elements are used to insert
            non-content elements into an HTML document, such as images, input fields, and line breaks.</p>  
        <p>Void elements are written with a single tag, and there is no need for a closing tag or content inside the tag.</p>  
        <p>Void elements are self-closing, which means that they end with a forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket (>).</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of common void elements in HTML:</p>
           <img>: Used to insert images into a document.<br>
           <input>:Used to create input fields for forms.<br>
           <br>: Used to insert a line break or carriage return.<br>
           <meta>: Used to provide metadata information about a document, such as keywords or descriptions.<br>
           
        <u><strong>Example</u></strong>- <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful mountain landscape" />
            
        <p>In this example, the <img> tag is used to insert an image into the HTML document. The src attribute 
            specifies the URL of the image file, while the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image.
        </p>
        <hr>
    <h2>(4).What are HTML Entities? With Example.</h2>

        <p>=>HTML entities are special codes that can be used to represent characters and symbols that have a special meaning in HTML,</p>
        <p> but can't be represented using standard ASCII characters.</p>
        <p> HTML entities are typically used to display special characters, such as
            trademark symbols, accented letters, or mathematical symbols, that aren't available on a standard keyboard.</p>  
        <p>HTML entities are defined using a specific syntax that includes an ampersand (&) followed by a unique identifier and a semicolon (;)
            to mark the end of the code. For example, the HTML entity code for the copyright symbol (Â©) is &copy;.</p>
        <p>HTML entities are important because they allow web developers to include special characters and symbols 
           in an HTML document without </p>   
        <p>causing errors or unexpected behavior. By using HTML entities, developers can ensure that their HTML documents are properly encoded 
            and can be displayed correctly across different browsers and devices.</p>  
        <p></p>      

           <strong><u>example:-</u></strong>
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <body>
            
            <h3>HTML Entity Example</h3>
            
            <h4>The copyright symbol: &copy;</h4>
            
            </body>
            </html>
            <hr>

    <h2>(5).What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h2> 

         =>There are two main types of lists in HTML:-

         <p><b>1.Unordered lists (&lt;u&gt;):</b> Used to create a list of items that are not in a specific order,
            such as a bullet point list.</P> 
         <P><b>2.Ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;):</b> Used to create a list of items in a specific order, such as a numbered list.</p>
 
         <p><b>unordered list</b> is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence.
             This list is created by using HTML &lt;/ul&gt; tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet. </p>

         <p>You can use type attribute for &lt;ul&gt; tag to specify the type of bullet you like. 
            By default, it is a disc. Following are the possible options</p>   
            &lt;ul type = "square"&gt;<br>
            &lt;ul type = "disc"&gt;<br>
            <p>&lt;ul type = "circle"&gt;</p>

        <b>Example:-</b>

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
           <head>
              <title>HTML Unordered List</title>
           </head>
            
           <body>
              <h3>HTML Unordered List</h3>
                <ul type = "square">
                    <li>square</li>
                </ul>
                <ul type = "disc">
                    <li>disc</li>
                </ul>
                <ul type = "circle">
                    <li>circle</li>
                </ul>
           </body>
        </html>

        <p><b>Ordered list</b>If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered list will be used.
             This list is created by using &lt;ol&gt; tag. The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each 
             successive ordered list element tagged with &lt;li&gt;.</p>

        <p> You can use type attribute for &lt;ol&gt; tag to specify the type of numbering you like. By default, it is a number. 
            Following are the possible options</p>

                &lt;ol type = "1"&gt; - Default-Case Numerals<br>
                &lt;ol type = "I"&gt; - Upper-Case Numerals<br>
                &lt;ol type = "i"&gt; - Lower-Case Numerals<br>
                &lt;ol type = "A"&gt; - Upper-Case Letters<br>
                &lt;ol type = "a"&gt; - Lower-Case Letters</p>    

         <b>Example:-</b>
         
         <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
         <head>
         <title>HTML Ordered List</title>
         </head>
         <body>
            <h3>HTML Ordered List</h3>
            <ol type = "1">
                <li>Default-Case Numerals</li>
         </ol>
         <ol type = "I">
            <li>Upper-Case Numerals</li>
         </ol>
         
         <ol type = "i">
            <li>Lower-Case Numerals</li>
         </ol>
         
         <ol type = "A">
            <li>Upper-Case Letters</li>
         </ol>
         <ol type = "a">
            <li>Lower-Case Letters</li>
         </ol>

    <h2>(6).What is the 'class' attribute in HTML? With Example.</h2>  

       =>The HTML <b>class</b> attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.<br>
       Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.<br>
       The <b>class</b> attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet.<br>
       In the following example we have three<b> &lt;div&gt;</b> elements with a <b>class</b> attribute with the value of "city".
       All of the three <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> elements will be styled equally according to the  <b>.city</b> style definition in the head section:<br><br>
      
        <b>Example-&lt;div class="header"&gt;This is a header&lt;/div&gt;</b>
        <br>
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
       <head>
       <style>
       .city {
         background-color: rgb(150, 12, 104);
         color: white;
         border: 2px solid black;
         margin: 10px;
         padding: 10px;
       }
       </style>
       </head>
       <body>
       
       <div class="city">
         London
         <p>india is the capital of New Delhi</p>
       </div>
       </body>
       </html>
       
       <hr>
    
    <h2>(7).What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML
        elements? With Example.</h2>

        =>In HTML, the 'id' and 'class' attributes are used to identify and apply styles to specific elements in a web page.<br>
        The main difference between them is that 'id' is used to uniquely identify a single element on a page,
        while 'class' is used to identify a group of elements that share the same style or behavior.<br><br>

        Here are some more details about each attribute:<br>
        <b>id:</b> The 'id' attribute is used to give a unique identifier to an element.
        Each 'id' attribute value must be unique within a single HTML document.
        This makes it easy to reference a specific element in CSS 
        using the '#' selector. For example, if you have a button with an 'id' of 'myButton',
        you could apply styles to it in CSS using '#myButton'.<br><br>

           <b>&lt;div id="header"&gt;
           &lt;h3&gt;ID Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
           &lt;/h3&gt;</b>
       <br>
       <br>

        <b>class:</b> The 'class' attribute is used to identify a group of elements that share the same 
        style or behavior. Unlike 'id', multiple elements on a page can have the same 'class' attribute
        value. This makes it easy to apply styles to a group of elements using CSS. For example, 
        if you have a group of buttons with a 'class' of 'btn', you could apply styles to all of them in CSS using '.btn'.<br><br>
           
           <b>&lt;p class=".capital"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/p&gt;</b>
    <hr>

    <h2>(8).What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h2>
        
       
        =>  &lt;h1&gt; to  &lt;h6&gt;: These tags are used to define headings of different sizes, with
        <h1>&lt;h1&gt;being the largest and&lt;/h1&gt;</h1>
         <h6>&lt;h6&gt;being the smallest.&lt;/h6&gt;</h6>
    <br>
         <p>&lt;p&gt;: This tag is used to define paragraphs.</p>
    <br>
        <strong>&lt;strong&gt;: These tags are used to make text bold.</strong>
    <br>        
        <em>&lt;em&gt; or <i>&lt;i&gt;: These tags are used to make text italic.</i></em>
    <br>        
        <u>&lt;u&gt;: This tag is used to underline text.</u>
    <br>        
        <sup>&lt;sup&gt;: This tag is used to create superscript text.</sup>
    <br>    
        <sub>&lt;sub&gt;: This tag is used to create subscript text.</sub>
    <br>    
        <blockquote>&lt;blockquote&gt;: This tag is used to create a block of quoted text.</blockquote>
    <br>    
        <pre>&lt;pre&gt;: This tag is used to preserve whitespace and display text in a fixed-width font.</pre>
    <br>    
        <code>&lt;code&gt;: This tag is used to display code snippets.</code>
    <br>    
        <ul>&lt;ul&gt; and <ol>&lt;ol&gt;: These tags are used to create unordered and ordered lists, respectively.</ul>
    <br>    
       <li>&lt;li&gt;: This tag is used to define list items</li>
    <br>    
        <br>&lt;br&gt;: This tag is used to insert a line break.
        <hr>&lt;hr&gt;: This tag is used to create a horizontal line.</hr>

    <h2>(9).How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h2>

    =>Cell padding and cell spacing are two HTML attributes used to control the appearance and layout of tables.<br>

     <b>Cell padding</b>: is used to add space between the content of a cell and its border.<br> 
    It defines the amount of space between the content of the cell and the edge of the cell's border.<br>
    The value of cell padding is specified in pixels or as a percentage of the cell's width.<br>

        <b>Example:-</b>   
     
   <!DOCTYPE html> 
   <html> 
   <head> 
       <title>HTML table cellpadding</title> 
   </head> 
   <body> 
       <h3>HTML table cellpadding Attribute </h3> 
       <table border="1"
           cellpadding="15"> 
           <tr> 
               <td>Cell 1</td> 
               <td>Cell2</td>  
           </tr> 
       </table> 
   </body> 
   </html> 
   
   <br> 
         <b>Cell spacing</b>: on the other hand, is used to control the amount of space between adjacent cells in a table. It defines 
         the amount of space between the borders of adjacent cells. The value of cell spacing is also specified in pixels or 
         as a percentage of the table's width.<br>
          
         <b>Example:</b>

         <!DOCTYPE html> 
         <html> 
         <head> 
             <title>HTML table cellspacing</title> 
         </head>
         <body>
             <h3>HTML table cellspacing</h3> 
         
             <table border="1" cellspacing="10"> 
                 <tr> 
                     <th>Cell 1</th> 
                     <td>Cell 2</td> 
                 </tr> 
             </table> 
         </body> 
         
         </html>  
   <hr>

    <h2>(10).How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.</h2>

         =>HTML provides the rowspan and colspan attributes to combine two or more rows or columns in a table into a single row or column.<br>
    
         To combine two or more cells in a row into a single cell, you can use the colspan attribute.<br> 
         The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span.<br>
          
         <b>Example:</b>
         <br>
           <!DOCTYPE html>
           <html lang="en">
           <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>colspan</title>
           </head>
           <body>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                  <td colspan="2">Merged Cell</td>
                  <td>Cell 3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Cell 4</td>
                  <td>Cell 5</td>
                  <td>Cell 6</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              
           </body>
           </html>

           To combine two or more cells in a column into a single cell, you can use the rowspan attribute.<br> 
           The rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span.<br>
   
           <b>Example:</b>
           <br>
           <!DOCTYPE html>
           <html lang="en">
           <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

           <body>
            <table border="1">
                    <tr>
                      <td rowspan="2">Merged Cell</td>
                      <td>Cell 2</td>
                      <td>Cell 3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Cell 5</td>
                      <td>Cell 6</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
           </body>
           </html>
    <hr>    
    <h2>(11).What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h2>
      
      =><b>Inline elements</b> never start from a new line. 
        Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.<br>

        <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
         <body>

           <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

     <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

        </body>
        </html>
    <br>
       <b>Block elements</b> cover space from left to right as far as it can go. 
        Block elements have top and bottom margins.<br>

        <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

</body>

    <h2>(12).How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.</h2>

    =>
    To create a hyperlink in HTML, you can use the <a> tag, which stands for anchor. Here is the basic syntax of the <a> tag:<br>
    
    The href attribute specifies the URL or web address of the page you want to link to.<br>
    
    The text between the opening and closing <a> tags is the link text that will be displayed on the webpage. When a user clicks
     on this link, they will be taken to the URL specified in the href attribute.<br>
    
    You can also add additional attributes to the <a> tag to control the behavior and appearance of the link. For example, you can
     use the target attribute to specify whether the linked page should open in the same window or in a new window or tab.<br> 
    <b>Example:</b>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube will open</a><br>
     <a href="https://www.google.com/">Go to Google</a><br>
    <hr>

    <h2>(13).What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.</h2>

    => &lt;iframe&gt; tag in HTML stands for inline frame. It is used to embed another HTML document or web page within the current<br> 
        HTML document. The content displayed within the &lt;iframe&gt; is essentially a separate web page, but it is displayed within the current

    <h2>(14).What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h2>

            =>The <span> tag in HTML is used to group inline-elements and apply CSS styles to them. 
            It is a generic inline container that does not have any semantic meaning on its own, but it allows you to group and apply styles to a 
            specific section of text or other inline content within a larger block of content.<br>
           
           <p>This is a &lt;span&gt; style="color: red;">red&lt;/span&gt; text.</p>
           
           he <span> tag can also be used in combination with JavaScript or other scripting languages to add dynamic behavior to a web page.<br>
            For example, you can use the <span> tag to highlight or modify specific sections of text based on user input or other events.<br>
           
           Overall, the <span> tag is a versatile and powerful tool for styling and manipulating inline content within a web page,
           and it allows you to apply a wide range of visual effects and interactive behaviors to your content.<br>

    <h2>(15).How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.</h2>
           
            =>First, you need to create a container element, such as a &lt;div&gt; tag, that will contain the background image and
              the picture.<br>

        <div class="background-container">
          <!-- Your content here -->
        </div>
        <br>
        
        Next, you need to set the background image for the container element using the background-image property. You can use a URL 
        to specify the location of the background image.<br>
        
        <!--.background-container
         {
          background-image: url("c:\Users\Shreya Bhalani\Pictures\sb.jpg");
         }-->
        
        Finally, you cbroan insert the picture into the container element using an <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag or any other HTML element that displays images.<br>
    
          <img src="c:\Users\Shreya Bhalani\Pictures\sb.jpg" alt="Picture" width="20%" height="40%">

    <h2>(16).How are active links different from normal links?</h2>

          =>Active links and normal links are two different states that a hyperlink can have, 
          based on the user's interaction with it.<br>

           <b>normal link</b> is a hyperlink that is not currently being interacted with by the user. 
           It is typically displayed with an underline and a different color from the surrounding text,
           and it appears as a clickable link. When a user clicks on a normal link, it will take
           them to the specified URL.<br>
          
           <b>active link,</b> on the other hand, is a hyperlink that is currently being interacted with by the user.<br> 
           It typically appears differently than a normal link, often with a different background color or border,
            to indicate that it is currently being clicked or hovered over.<br>
           This allows the user to see which link they are interacting with in real-time. Once the user clicks on the link, it will take them to the
           specified URL, just like a normal link.<br>

    <h2>(17).What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h2>
        
         =><b>&lt;p&gt;</b> tag: This tag is used to create paragraphs of text. It is one of the most commonly used tags for separating sections of text.<br>

            <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> to <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b> tags: These tags are used to create headings and subheadings for the text. The number after the "h" indicates the 
            level of the heading, with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the lowest.<br>
            
            <b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> tag: This tag is used to create a horizontal line to separate sections of text. It can be used to visually break up a long page 
            of text into smaller sections.<br>
            
            <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> tag: This tag is used to insert a line break within a paragraph of text. It can be used to create white space between two lines
             of text or to separate short sections of text.<br>
            
            <b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b> tag: This tag is used to create a block quote or a section of text that is quoted from another source. It is typically 
            indented and displayed in a different font style to set it apart from the rest of the text.<br>
            
            <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b> tag: This tag is used to display preformatted text, which preserves the spacing and line breaks of the original text. It is 
            commonly used for displaying code or other types of formatted text.<br>
            
            <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;span&gt;</b> tags: These tags are used to create container elements that can be used to group sections of text together
             for styling or other purposes. <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> is typically used for larger sections of text, while <b>&lt;span&gt;</b> is used for smaller sections of text.<br>

    <h2>(18).What is SVG?</h2>

          =>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector graphics format based on XML that is used to display graphics and images
          on the web.<br> 
          Unlike raster graphics formats such as JPEG or PNG, which are made up of a grid of pixels, SVG images are made up
          of mathematical shapes and lines that can be scaled up or down without losing quality.<br>
         
         SVG images can be created using a variety of software tools, including Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and Sketch.<br> 
         They can also be created directly in a text editor using SVG markup code.<br>
         
         SVG images have several advantages over other image formats.<br> 
         Because they are vector-based, they can be scaled up or down without losing quality, making them ideal for
         creating graphics that need to be displayed at different sizes.<br>

    <h2>(19).What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2>
        
          =><b>Syntax:</b> The syntax of XHTML is stricter and more standardized than HTML. <br>
          XHTML requires all tags to be properly nested and closed, whereas HTML allows for more flexible syntax.<br> 
          This means that XHTML is more consistent and easier to parse by web browsers and  other software.<br>
    
          <b>Case sensitivity:</b> XHTML is case sensitive, meaning that all tags and attributes must be written in lowercase.<br> 
          In HTML, tag and attribute names are not case sensitive.<br>
    
          <b>Parsing:</b> XHTML documents must be well-formed and valid XML documents, meaning that they must conform to a specific set of rules and guidelines.<br> 
          HTML documents are not required to be well-formed or valid, although it is good practice to follow certain guidelines.<br>
    
          MIME  type: XHTML documents are served with a different MIME type (application/xhtml+xml) than HTML documents (text/html).

    <h2>(20).What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h2>
          
    =>
    Logical tags are used to provide meaning to the content of a web page. They describe the function of the content, 
    rather than how it should look. <br>

    Examples of logical tags include &lt;h1&gt; for headings, &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, and &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; for lists.<br>

    Physical tags, on the other hand, are used to define the appearance or presentation of content. They describe how the content should look,
     rather than what it means. Examples of physical tags include &lt;font&gt; for changing the font, &lt;b&gt; for bold text, and &lt;i&gt; for italic text.
    Logical tags are generally preferred over physical tags, because they provide more semantic meaning to the content and make it more 
    accessible to users with disabilities or using assistive technologies.<br>
    
    Additionally, logical tags are more flexible and adaptable to different devices and platforms, since they are not tied to specific presentation styles.<br>
    However, physical tags can still be useful in certain cases 
    where a specific presentation style is desired, such as for styling text with custom fonts or colors.<br>
